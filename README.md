### Description

AudioRecorder is a program for recording sound. You can select the bit rate, 8/16 bits and stereo/mono. It is possible to make a manual recording, but is is also possible to program a recording. The recording can be saved, if you like automatically. All settings are stored in the registry.

Furthermore you can choose a midi file (use "Settings") to record. As soon as you hit the "Record" button the midi file starts playing and it is recorded as a wave file at the same time.

Some minor bugs have been removed! Furthermore you can now use long file names and map names with spaces in it.
